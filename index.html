        <p>Weeks after Arvind Kejriwal's comments - on including photographs of Hindu Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Ganesha on currency notes - sparked controversy, the Delhi Chief Minister recalled what he meant. In the final session of the five days long HT Leadership Summit 2022, Kejriwal on Saturday stressed that "blessings are needed to reap fruitful results". "We are just mere living beings. We put in a lot of efforts. But at times, we don't get results," the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief said, speaking at the HTLS 2022. "So we need hard work, yes, for what we seek. And we need God's blessings too. That's all I had said."</p>
        <p>"What I meant was our country is dealing with multiple challenges. People across the country should work hard, governments too should work hard. But the efforts will reap results only when God showers his blessings. So what I had suggested was that if the currency notes carry the photos of Lakshmi - the Goddess of Wealth - and Ganesha, they will bless us," Kejriwal further shared, recalling the comment.</p>
